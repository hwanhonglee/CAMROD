4. Create a branch to hold your changes:

        $ git checkout -b my-feature

be pushed directly to the master branch by the maintainer without a review.
"Tiny" means backwards compatibility is mandatory and all tests must succeed.
No new feature must be added.

one other developer and merged by the maintainer. New features must be
documented and tested. Breaking changes must be discussed and announced
in advance with deprecation warnings.
